You can visit the deployed version of the app at the link 'https://son421.github.io/table-app/'.
This app is built with React Redux and written in TypeScript, with the additional UI library react-icons. Itâ€™s deployed using GitHub Pages.

When you access the app, you'll see a table of users. You can initiate a search among users by clicking the 'Search' button, which opens
a window with a form allowing you to search for users by criteria such as 'Name', 'Username', 'Email', or 'Phone'. You can search using 
multiple criteria simultaneously. As soon as you start typing in the search fields, the search begins. When you clear all the text from the
search fields or close the search window, the search stops.
